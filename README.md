# MarkerConverter 
/*is a short project I started back in 2021 with the original intent to familiarize myself with the C# language. Although it doesn't cover the more extensive part of its expertise (such as OOP), I wanted to start practising, and how else than with a very simple converter that would save time typing out on discord. Version is still buggy, so be warned
